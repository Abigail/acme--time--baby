NAME
    Acme::Time::Baby -- Tell time little children can understand

SYNOPSIS
        use Acme::Time::Baby;
        print babytime;           #  Prints current time.

        use Acme::Time::Baby language => 'du';
        print babytime "10:15";   #  Prints a quarter past ten in a way
                                  #  little Dutch children can understand.

DESCRIPTION
    Using this module gives you the function "babytime", which will return
    the time in the form The big hand is on the ten and the little hand is
    on the three. If no argument to "babytime" is given, the current time is
    used, otherwise a time of the form *hh:mm* can be passed. Both 12 and 24
    hour clocks are supported.

    When using the module, various options can be given. The following
    options can be passed:

    language LANG
        The language the time should be told in. The following languages are
        currently supported:

          en             English (this is the default)
          br             Brazilian Portuguese.
          ceb            Cebuano (Filipine dialect)
          de             German.
          du             Dutch.
          es             Spanish.
          fr             French.
          it             Italian.
          no             Norwegian.
          se             Swedish.
          swedish chef   Swedish Chef (from the Muppets).
          warez          l44+.

        If no language argument is given, English is used.

        Note that some languages use accented letters. The returned
        sentences are correct for an ISO 8859-1 platform.

    format STRING
        This is the format used to represent the time. It will be passed to
        "sprintf", and it should have two %s formatting codes. The other two
        arguments to "sprintf" are the position of the minute hand (the big
        hand) and the hour hand (the little hand). If you have perl 5.8 or
        above, you could use "%2$s" and "%1$s" to reverse the order.

    number ARRAYREF
        An array with the names of the numbers one to twelve, to be used in
        the formatted time.

    noimport EXPR
        By default, the sub "babytime" will be exported to the calling
        package. If for some reason the calling package does not want to
        import the sub, there are two ways to prevent this. Either use "use
        Acme::Time::Baby ()", which will prevent "Acme::Time::Baby::import"
        to be called, or pass "noimport" followed by a true value as
        arguments to the "use" statement.

PACKAGE NAME
    It has been said this package should be named 'Acme::Time::Toddler',
    because it's the language toddlers speak, and not babies.

    However, the idea of this package is based on an X application the
    author saw more than 10 years before this package was written. It would
    display a clock, telling the current time, in a myriad of languages. One
    of the languages was *babytalk*, and used a language very similar to the
    one in this package. Hence the name of this package.

TODO
    Support for more languages.
